#Tool Comparison Utility  
  
###What is this?  
This tool is a super simple tool for taking host exports from tools (like Rapid7 InsightIDR and SentinelOne) and parsing through them to find gaps in coverage between them. Kind of a niche use case, but it was helpful and easy to write.  
  
###Why use this?  
I don't know! Maybe it'll help you with some weird niche problem.  
  
###How to use this?
1. Using the assetList.csv template import your assets using the format shown. Leave MissingWhich set to none.
2. Run the script.
3. Nailed it.
